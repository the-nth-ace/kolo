# Kolo

## Project Description

**What Kolo is:** 
Kolo is a loose implementation of [Nigeria‚Äôs Open Banking API](https://openbanking.ng/) . 
Thanks to *this repository*, I was able to implement without too much of a hassle. 
Using Typescript and ExpressJs as the language and primary framework respectively, 

**What Kolo is not:** As far as I know, Kolo is not production ready as there would be considerations to be made for more extensive tests, and its ability to scale. Integration of third party apis for authentication, identity verification, payments etc need to be reconsidered.
