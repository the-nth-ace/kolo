# Kolo

## Project Description

**What Kolo is:** Kolo (Backend) is my attempt at building the best possible software I can at the moment. After a little over a year of working across programming languagesâ€”Python, JavaScript, and Typescript and a single time C#. Frameworksâ€” Django, Flask, FastAPI, Express, ReactJS, VueJS, AngularJS, NestJS. Technologiesâ€”Heroku, Git/GitHub, Docker. Database infrastructuresâ€” SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB. Programming paradigms and principles, Design Patterns and so on, . Kolo is a culmination of all I have learnt. Although, for this iteration, I opted for a monolith rather than a microservice architecture, I think it is appropriate. Later in the future, I will implement the entire software with microservices.

Using Typescript and ExpressJs as the language and  framework respectively, I implemented clean architecture as I understood it at the time of development,  *making sure logic depended on data and adapters on logic.* Unit and integration tests were written in jest and <> respectively and the current test coverage is in the shields above. Authentication was implemented with JWT.

**What <> is not:** As far as I know, Kolo is not production ready as there would be considerations to be made for more extensive tests, and its ability to scale. Integration of third party apis for authentication, identity verification, payments etc need to be reconsidered.
